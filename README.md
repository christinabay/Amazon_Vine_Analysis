The purpose of this analysis was to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program, then use PySpark to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.

Results: 
How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
- Vine: 0 
- Non-vine: 4532

How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
- Vine: 0
- Non-vine: 2507, 55%

Summary: 
Because for this specific dataset there were no paid reviews, there is no positivity bias. All reviews are unpaid, therefore we can assume the bias is low.
